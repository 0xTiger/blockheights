# blockheights
A collection of Python scripts for scraping and visualising the minecraft world.

## dataset
The dataset provided has been scraped from about 1 billion blocks, over 15 regions. 
The region files were generated using minecraft version 1.15.1

## scraper
The majority of the work here is done by [my fork of the anvil library](https://github.com/0xTiger/anvil-parser). It can be installed directly from github using pip: `git+https://github.com/0xTiger/anvil-parser.git`

## reader
The first related [visualisation](https://www.reddit.com/efvgve) I posted on reddit was made using oreheights_reader.py, the latter (animation) was made using blockheights_reader.py. 
The icons I used for each block can be found by extracting the minecraft jarfile. I will not redistribute these on github.
